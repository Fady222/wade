# Contribution Guide

## Contributing to the Code

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch with a meaningful name
3. Commit with a meaningful commit message that starts with a verb in simple present. 
    Example: "update readme" and NOT "I have updated readme" or "Updating readme" 
4. Push to your own fork. Do a pull request to the original repo 

### Remarks:

* Use camelCase for variable names * Write a comment block for every function you create that describes:
    * What the function does
    * What are its inputs
    * What are its outputs

## Contributing with Issues 

* Write an issue for every single thing you notice as wrong or unusual. This creates information for the upcoming users.
* When writing an issue, first put a filter. E.g.:
    * "[documentation] Guide line X describes a wrong use case"
    * "[frontend] " Button in TD selection is not working"
